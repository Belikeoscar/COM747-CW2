Component 1 – Groupwork
Students will be allocated to groups. In your allocated group, all group members are to work together to undertake a data science project and to co-author and submit a research paper that should be around 4 pages in length (3000 words) using the IEEE file format/template which can be found online (https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html). The IEEE file format/template (Microsoft Word version) may also be found in the module assessment area on blackboard learn. You can either use the Microsoft Word IEEE template or the IEEE overleaf/LaTeX template. The body text in the IEEE template should be Times New Roman (size 10). Remember effective communication is a key part of writing research papers.

In your group, please decide who will be the team leader. The team leader is responsible for submitting the IEEE research paper on behalf of the whole team/group. The team leader should email Okunola Orogun or okunolaadebola.orogun@qa.com and inform them of who the team leader is for the group, preferably before the end of week 4 (approximately).

As a group, you might also want to think about using onedrive so that the group can share, write and add content using the same ‘living’ shared document. You should also consider using any other collaborative tools that may help support the communication and interaction between team members, for example, this can include tools such as Microsoft Teams, Blackboard Learn, Git and other tools. You might also consider having a shared data science lab book which could be a shared document that allows all team members to include data analysis and results etc.

In your allocated group, you should collectively undertake a data science project. As a group, you should first select an open dataset that is of interest to the group. The data science project can be related to your experience and is ideally related to a real-world context/challenge. Open datasets can be found on websites such as the UCI repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets) and Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). You may also consider open datasets from PURE (https://pure.ulster.ac.uk/en/datasets/) where datasets from the school’s research centres or indeed from other research centres in Ulster may also be available. 

As a group, all members should meet regularly and discuss the project. The group should setup a weekly team meeting and also meet during the lab sessions when possible. The group should also keep agendas and minutes of meetings and record those who were and were not in attendance. Your group should also use the scheduled lab time to get continued support in progressing this assignment. 

Remember, this groupwork assessment will also include self and peer assessment. Self and peer assessment is when each group member evaluates/scores their own contribution to the project and also evaluates/scores the contribution made by the other group members. This self and peer assessment may be used to adjust your group submission mark in instances where your contribution to the group submission is poor (more details are in this brief). Each individual student should submit self and peer assessments before the submission deadline. The self and peer assessment form will either be completed multiple times by you (once for each peer assessment and once for your own self-assessment) using an online Microsoft form, or using the self and peer assessment form that can be submitted once using a word document submitted to blackboard. The module coordinator/teaching staff will let you know whether you are to complete the self and peer assessment using the online Microsoft form or using a word document (in some circumstances you may be asked to complete the self and peer assessment by submitting an excel spreadsheet to blackboard).

This group project should include the use of a programming language such as R and/or Python as well as the implementation of data science and machine learning techniques to analyse your chosen open dataset. The project should also have a clear aim and objectives. As a group, you should go through a data science/machine learning lifecycle, for example, using CRISP-DM. Your group project should include data importing/cleaning/wrangling, statistical analysis, data visualisation, feature engineering and modelling (machine learning). This group-based data science project should also consider, discuss and/or be guided by the Legal, Social, Ethical and Professional issues and implications across the stages in your project and implement any appropriate processes. You should also consider any factors related to equality, diversity, and inclusion as well as sustainability when implementing your data science project, where appropriate. 

The IEEE research paper should include the following headings/sections (you may wish to add other section headings):

1.	Title
2.	Abstract
3.	Introduction
a.	Related works
b.	Aim and objectives
4.	Methods
5.	Results
6.	Discussion
a.	Limitations
7.	Conclusion
8.	References (in an IEEE referencing style or a referencing style similar to IEEE)

The research paper should detail the data access, the data science techniques, methods and packages that were used as well as any data analysis, results, visualisations and modelling (machine learning). The research paper should also present any evaluation and validation of the data analysis/machine learning etc. Remember to use scholarly references/citations (textbooks, journal papers and conference papers). Also be sure to use an IEEE referencing style or a referencing style similar to IEEE.
Word limit of the paper 
The word limit of the paper is 3000 words. We will allow up to 10% over this limit (i.e. 3300 words). However, we may not mark any content beyond 10% over the limit, so please ensure to adhere to the specified agreed limit of 3000 words. There are no other additional penalties applied beyond not marking/assessing content beyond 10% over the limit. The marker should note when this is the case – i.e. the approximate point in the paper when they stopped marking (likely at 3300 words). Word limit does not include references. 
You are required to include the number of words in your paper at the end of the document. (e.g. Word limit excluding references = 2965 words).
Self and peer assessment
Each student will score themselves and each member in their group out of 10 (where 5/10 is a kind of pass mark and a score of 10 is excellent). Students will use the following guide:
Self/peer assessment rubric for students to use.
	Score = 7 to 10	Score = 6 – 6.9
	Score = 5 – 5.9
	Score = 0 to 4.9



Self/Peer Assessment 	
Excellent proactive engagement and contribution to this Groupwork assignment.	
Good engagement and made a good contribution to this Groupwork assignment.	
Satisfactory engagement but often reactive than proactive. Made a satisfactory contribution to Groupwork assignment.
	
Score = 0 to 4.9: Very limited engagement with peers and a very limited contribution to this Groupwork assignment. A score of 0 would mean no contribution at all and no engagement at all (e.g. did not attend any meetings).

The rounded average self/peer assessment scores for each student will be calculated. If a student’s rounded average self/peer assessment score is 5 or above (given 5/10 is deemed a pass and deemed satisfactory) then the student is awarded all of the group paper marks. However, if a student’s rounded average self/peer review score is below 5, their mark for the group paper will be reduced using the following formula:
group paper mark * (raw-average-self-peer-assessment-score / 5)

Worked example:
For example, if a student’s raw average self/peer assessment score and their rounded average self/peer assessment score was 3 out of 10 and the group paper had a mark of 30 out of 50 – then this individual student would be awarded 18 out of 50 for the group paper submission.
i.e. 30 * (3 / 5) = 18

Component 2 - Individual Component (50%)

As an individual, you are to submit an individual video presentation (video presentation should be 4 minutes in duration]) to blackboard learn as well as the group code document in PDF. 

Whilst the code document is co-authored by the group and is not part of the marking criteria, you should each submit this individually to evidence your involvement in the group work. 
	
In this individual video presentation, you should first very briefly summarise the data science project. In your own words, you should then present the technical code implementation of the project and then describe the technical aspects and code that you mainly contributed to, which should be the main focus of the video. To be clear, you should mainly highlight your individual technical code contributions and discuss your approach to ensuring that your code contributions are readable, updatable, maintainable, and reusable. You can use powerpoint slides and/or demonstrate code in your code editor to describe and showcase the code and technical implementation details. It is appreciated that the code will likely have been co-developed collectively in the group but there will be aspects to the coding/implementation that you have predominantly led on. Also as a team member, you should be able to showcase your technical understanding on all or most other aspects of the code. Use the assessment criteria in this document to guide/structure your video presentation.

To create and record the video presentation, you will need to use screen casting software (e.g. Panopto). Please submit your video in .mp4 video file format and please do not use other video formats such as .wmv. 

To be clear, you should work on this video presentation individually and not as part of a team, i.e. you should not be sharing your individual video presentation with others or working with others on this individual presentation/submission. 
Duration limit of the individual video presentation 
The duration limit of the video presentation is 4 minutes. We will allow up to 10% over this limit (i.e. 4mins and 24 seconds). However, we may not mark any content beyond 10% over the limit, so please ensure to adhere to the specified agreed limit of 4 minutes. There are no other additional penalties applied beyond not marking/assessing content beyond 10% over the limit. The marker should note when this is the case – i.e. the approximate point in the video when they stopped marking (likely around 4mins and 24 seconds). 
You may wish to record a video and then edit this down to the required duration.
In summary, the following files should be submitted before the deadline:
•	Group submission:
1.	The group/team leader should submit a PDF of the IEEE research paper (3000 words).

•	Individual submission:
Each student should submit the following:
1.	Video presentation (4 minutes in length). Preferably submitted in mp4 video file format.

2.	Any slides you may have used in the video (in PDF).

3.	Code implementation from the group project (in PDF). Ensure the PDF includes the code as text, i.e. do NOT include screenshots of code.

4.	Self and peer review form/s. The module coordinator/teaching team will provide a self-peer assessment word document and/or an online Microsoft form or an excel spreadsheet to complete your self and peer assessments.


General advice/notes:
1)	Coursework submitted late may not be marked and you may receive a mark of 0.
2)	Ensure that the video presentation is uploaded correctly (check the video is playing in the browser within blackboard) – otherwise it may not be marked.
3)	You may need to record the video multiple times so do allow yourself enough time to record your presentation.
4)	Be sure to read the assessment criteria/rubrics to help guide your submissions.
5)	Ensure code is structured and well commented.
6)	Do not plagiarise. Use quotes when quoting a source. Include references and citations. Make sure you understand what plagiarism is and the penalties for plagiarism offences (https://ulster.sharepoint.com.mcas.ms/sites/AcademicIntegrity). 
7)	All submitted assignment files should have the file name: "SurnameFirstNameBNumber" 
e.g. BrownJohnB00001234_Assignment.
